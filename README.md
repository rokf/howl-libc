### libc API for Howl

This extends the **C** bundle with an API. It includes man pages for functions available inside **libc**.

This was generated on **Alpine Linux** which uses **musl libc**. The whole standard library is included inside
a single **libc.so** file.

Currently the API can only be accessed via the documentation shortcut (**Ctrl+Q** by default).
API completion is disabled (commented out).

### Installation

```
cd ~/.howl/bundles
git clone https://github.com/rokf/howl-libc
```
